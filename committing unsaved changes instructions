To commit all uncommitted changes from the terminal, you can follow these steps:

Check Status:
Before committing, it's good practice to check the status of your repository to see which files are modified, added, or deleted. You can do this by running:

lua
Copy code
git status
Add Changes:
Add all modified files to the staging area using the following command:

csharp
Copy code
git add .
This command stages all changes in the current directory and its subdirectories.

Commit Changes:
Commit the changes with a descriptive message using the git commit command. Replace your_commit_message with an appropriate message summarizing the changes:

sql
Copy code
git commit -m "your_commit_message"
For example:

sql
Copy code
git commit -m "Add new features and fix bugs"
Push Changes (Optional):
If you want to push the changes to a remote repository (like GitHub), use the git push command:

css
Copy code
git push origin main
Replace main with the name of your branch if you're not working on the main branch.
